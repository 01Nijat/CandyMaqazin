I noticed I didn't add a short Readme, I thought it was pointless, but it wasn't.)
In short, I made a jelly bean store and this is one of my first projects.
I already shared this on my github account, but that account is no longer active.
From the lists here, mssql, .net javascript, html, css, I coded myself. In the store, register, log in, basket, message, send a message to gmail.
If you forgot your password, redirect to gmail. In short, I prepared an online Jelibom store
